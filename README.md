# opengl_python_project
Welcome to the Linear Transformations Project! This project uses Python, OpenGL, and PyOpenGL to plot linear transformations of a triangle. You can plot multiple viewing transformations in the same window, including translation, reflection, rotation, shear, and scaling. These transformations can be applied consecutively by running the main.py program.

Installation
Before you can run this project, you'll need to install Python, OpenGL, and PyOpenGL. Here's how:

Install Python
Go to the Python website and download the latest version of Python.
Follow the prompts to install Python on your computer.
Install OpenGL
Go to the OpenGL website and follow the instructions to install OpenGL for your specific operating system.
Install PyOpenGL
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Make sure you have pip, the Python package manager, installed by running the following command: pip --version
If pip is not installed, run the following command to install it: pip install pip
Once pip is installed, run the following command to install PyOpenGL: pip install pyopengl
Running the Project

Once you have Python, OpenGL, and PyOpenGL installed, you're ready to run the project. Follow these steps:

Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Eclipse, Visual Studio).
Run the main.py file.
The program will prompt you to enter the desired transformation(s) you want to apply to the triangle. Follow the prompts to enter your transformation(s).
The transformed triangle will be displayed in a window.
Additional Notes
You can apply multiple transformations consecutively by entering them all at the same time, separated by a space.
The program will display an error message if you enter an invalid transformation.
The program will exit when you close the window displaying the transformed triangle.
I hope you enjoy using this project! If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out.
